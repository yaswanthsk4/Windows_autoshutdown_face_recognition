THe FACE_RECOGNITION requires dlib to be installed in windows, Thus the steps to install dlib as follows:
  1. Download and install Python version 3.6 (Do not install 3.7 since dlib is not pre-built for python)
  2. If you are using anaconda3 create a new venv and install python 3.6 using the command >>>conda install python=3.6.8
  3. After successful installation of python 3.6 download the dlib wheel file file from https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/da/06/bd3e241c4eb0a662914b3b4875fc52dd176a9db0d4a2c915ac2ad8800e9e/dlib-19.7.0-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl#sha256=d71c78dce0f7614e05b92518cf4ad654af9e8bfc9e15dea6af3c4dbb306bcd09
  4. Now install the downloaded dlib file using python terminal
  5. Now dlib will successfully install.
  6. Next install face_recognition using pip install face_recognition
  7. now that all the necessary files have been installed add one of your picture into the folder where py code is been saved and rename the picture to xxx.jpg (For example i have attached picture of obama as xxx.jpg Thus if any face else obama is detected your computer will shutdown!!)
  8. Now run the program, and if anyother person other than you is detected by your webcam then your pc will shutdown in 5 seconds.
